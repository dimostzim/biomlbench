# ðŸ§¬  [BEND](https://github.com/frederikkemarin/BEND) Zero-shot prediction of disease variants from ClinVar

Predicting variant effects is a binary problem, where single-bp mutations are classified as either having an effect or not. Each variant is a genomic position with a mutation $x âˆˆ {A, C, G, T}$ and a label $y âˆˆ {0, 1}$ indicating whether it is pathogenic or benign. The adjacent 512 bp serve as context. 

As this is a zero-shot task, we used the cosine distance in embedding space between a variant nucleotide and its reference nucleotide as the prediction score in BEND.
